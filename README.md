# tmux-vim

These are my tmux and vim configurations.

# tmux

Because there is no automatic way to retrieve the plugins, check the config and download them by yourself from github.

# vim

I use `Plug` for installing plugins in vim.
So you have to install `Plug` for your vim first, and create the directory .vim/plugged then you can run `:PlugInstall` and it starts installing, if there are problems with the colorschemes you are right now on your own, because I cannot remember how I fixed those to be honest. To update plugins use `:PlugUpdate`, there might be situations where the typical exlamation mark at the end of the two commands might be useful, sry if that sounds like sarcasm...
